# Clear Clipping Capability

Most of the PDF model classes including container classes like PDFParagraph/PDFTextLine/PDFPathGroup now implement ClippingDetachable with the method clearClipping().
This removes any clipping path which was active for this element.

This is useful in case clients want to move an element but the new position is hidden by the clipping path. clearing it makes the element visible again.

The new backend is version 1.8.6-rc2, available in the local m2 repository

## Test PDFs to use

examples/clipping/invisible-content-clipping-test.pdf

- A PDF where content is present but not visible due to clipping paths that exclude the content areas. Contains an image clipped away by one clipping path and vector paths clipped away by another clipping path.

## Implementation in pdfdancer-api

- Updated backend dependency to `com.tfc.pdf:pdfdancer-backend:1.8.6-rc2` in `build.gradle.kts` to use the clipping-detach support.
- Added client-facing helpers:
  - `BaseReference.clearClipping()` for any object reference implementing clipping detach semantics via the API.
  - `PathGroupReference.clearClipping()` for grouped vector paths.
  - `PDFDancer.clearClipping(ObjectRef)` calling `PUT /pdf/clipping/clear`.
  - `PDFDancer.clearPathGroupClipping(pageIndex, groupId)` calling `PUT /pdf/path-group/clipping/clear`.
  - Both client calls invalidate local snapshot caches after mutation.
- Added server endpoints in both controllers:
  - `PDFController` and `PDFControllerV1` expose `PUT /pdf/clipping/clear` and `PUT /pdf/path-group/clipping/clear`.
  - V1 uses `ClearClippingRequestV1` and `ClearPathGroupClippingRequestV1`, converting both to internal requests via `toInternal()`.
- Added controller orchestration in `ControllerOps`:
  - `clearClipping(...)` validates `objectRef`, executes `ClearObjectClippingCommand`, and publishes `PDF_OBJECT_MODIFIED` metric with operation `clear_clipping`.
  - `clearPathGroupClipping(...)` validates `groupId` and `pageIndex`, executes `ClearPathGroupClippingCommand`, and publishes `VECTOR_MANIPULATION` metric with operation `clear_path_group_clipping`.
- Wired session and replay support:
  - `Session.clearClipping(...)` and `Session.clearPathGroupClipping(...)` execute commands inside `SessionContext` and record commands for session history.
  - `CommandDeserializer` now reconstructs `ClearObjectClippingCommand` and `ClearPathGroupClippingCommand` for debug archive replay.
- Added tests and assertions:
  - `ClippingTest` verifies clearing clipping on `PathReference`, `PathGroupReference`, and `TextLineReference`.
  - `DirectPDFAssertions`/`PDFAssertions` gained helpers to detect clipped paths and assert clipping present/removed.


## Implementation in pdfdancer-client-python

- Added top-level client methods in `src/pdfdancer/pdfdancer_v1.py`: `PDFDancer.clear_clipping(object_ref)` calls `PUT /pdf/clipping/clear`, and `PDFDancer.clear_path_group_clipping(page_number, group_id)` calls `PUT /pdf/path-group/clipping/clear`.
- The Python client validates required inputs before sending the request: `object_ref` must be present, `page_number` is a 1-based integer for path groups, and `group_id` must be non-empty. Both methods coerce the API response to `bool` and invalidate cached snapshots after a successful mutation.
- Added object-level convenience methods in `src/pdfdancer/types.py`. `PDFObjectBase.clear_clipping()` makes the capability available on typed selections that expose `object_ref()` such as paths, images, and text lines, while `PathGroupObject.clear_clipping()` forwards to the path-group API using `self._page_index + 1` to convert the internal 0-based index to the public 1-based page number.
- Updated `README.md` to list `clear_clipping()` alongside other typed-object helper methods so the feature is discoverable from the main usage guide.
- Added end-to-end coverage in `tests/e2e/test_clipping.py` for direct object calls and top-level client calls on paths, grouped paths, images, and clipped text lines, including a case where clipping spans multiple content streams. `tests/e2e/pdf_assertions.py` was extended with PDF draw-event inspection helpers that assert whether clipping is present or removed.

## Implementation in pdfdancer-client-typescript

- Updated public docs in `README.md` so typed selector objects explicitly include `clearClipping()` alongside other object helpers.
- Extended client internals in `src/types.ts`:
  - Added `clearClipping(objectRef: ObjectRef): Promise<boolean>` to `PDFDancerInternals`.
  - Added `clearPathGroupClipping(pageNumber: number, groupId: string): Promise<boolean>` to path-group internals.
  - Added `BaseObject.clearClipping()` to clear clipping on any selected object and `BaseObject.objectRef()` as an explicit alias for `ref()`.
  - Added `PathGroupObject.groupId` getter and `PathGroupObject.clearClipping()` for path-group clipping removal.
- Implemented API wiring in `src/pdfdancer_v1.ts`:
  - Added `PDFDancer.clearClipping(objectRef)` with validation and `PUT /pdf/clipping/clear` using `{ objectRef: objectRef.toDict() }`.
  - Added `PDFDancer.clearPathGroupClipping(pageNumber, groupId)` with validation and `PUT /pdf/path-group/clipping/clear` using `{ pageNumber, groupId }`.
  - Both operations call `_invalidateCache()` after successful mutations so subsequent reads reflect unclipped content.
- Added clipping-aware e2e verification in `src/__tests__/e2e/pdf-assertions.ts`:
  - Added raw content stream parsing (including `FlateDecode` inflation), CTM math, clip-state tracking (`W`, `W*`, `n`, `q`, `Q`, `cm`), and draw-event matching for paths/images.
  - Added `assertPathHasClipping`, `assertPathHasNoClipping`, `assertImageHasClipping`, and `assertImageHasNoClipping` helpers to verify clipping removal behavior in saved PDFs.

## Implementation in pdfdancer-client-java

- Added client API helpers to expose clipping removal directly on references and the top-level client:
  - `BaseReference.clearClipping()` delegates to `PDFDancer.clearClipping(ObjectRef)`.
  - `PathGroupReference.clearClipping()` delegates to `PDFDancer.clearPathGroupClipping(pageIndex, groupId)`.
  - `PDFDancer` now provides both `clearClipping(ObjectRef)` and `clearPathGroupClipping(int pageIndex, String groupId)`, and invalidates snapshot caches after each mutation.
- Wired REST mutation calls in `ModificationService`:
  - `PUT /pdf/clipping/clear` with `ClearClippingRequest`.
  - `PUT /pdf/path-group/clipping/clear` with `ClearPathGroupClippingRequest`.
  - Both calls use JSON payloads, bearer auth, and `X-Session-Id` headers like other mutation endpoints.
- Updated docs and tests for this repo:
  - `README.md` selector helpers now mention `clearClipping()`.
  - `ClippingTest` covers path, image, text-line, and path-group clipping removal flows (via both reference helpers and direct `PDFDancer` APIs).
  - `PDFAssertions` gained clipping-aware assertions by parsing saved PDF content streams with PDFBox to detect whether matched draw events were clipped.
- Added `org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox:3.0.4` as a test dependency in `build.gradle.kts` to support low-level clipping assertions.
- Repo-specific request handling details: `ClearClippingRequest` serializes the target `objectRef`, and `PDFDancer.clearPathGroupClipping(int pageIndex, String groupId)` converts the client's 0-based `pageIndex` to the API's 1-based `pageNumber` before calling `PUT /pdf/path-group/clipping/clear`.

## Implementation in pdfdancer-api-docs

- Added clear-clipping user guides to the language-specific docs pages that already own those content types:
  - `docs/working-with-vector-graphics.md` documents clearing clipping on individual paths and path groups with helper-based examples.
  - `docs/working-with-images.md` adds an image-specific clipping section with Python, TypeScript, and Java examples.
  - `docs/working-with-text.md` adds clipping guidance for both paragraphs and text lines, including the note that clipped text can span multiple content streams.
- Added repo-wide terminology and release tracking:
  - `docs/glossary.md` defines "Clipping Path" so the guides can reference the concept consistently.
  - `docs/sdk-versions.md` was updated to version 8.7, records the upstream verification commits used for coverage, and adds the March 10, 2026 changelog entry for clear clipping.
- Repo-specific documentation details:
  - The docs explain the feature through per-language tabs rather than a standalone API reference page.
  - Examples favor the convenience helpers (`clear_clipping()` / `clearClipping()`) so the primary workflow stays minimal and does not suggest double-applying the same mutation.
  - The Java examples preserve the repo's existing `pageIndex` wording for `clearPathGroupClipping(...)`, while the SDK versions page calls out the underlying API's 1-based `pageNumber` behavior.

## Implementation in pdfdancer-client-python-examples

- Added a new clipping example in `examples/clipping/01_clear_clipping.py` plus `examples/clipping/README.md`, and checked in the fixture PDF `examples/clipping/invisible-content-clipping-test.pdf` that contains hidden image and vector content behind clipping paths.
- The example opens page 1 of the fixture, clears clipping on the first selected image with `image.clear_clipping()`, then groups the page paths with `page.group_paths(...)` and clears clipping on that path group with `path_group.clear_clipping()`. The modified document is written to `output/clipping/cleared_clipping.pdf`.
- Updated `README.md` so the new `examples/clipping/` category is listed in the repository layout, the fixture exception is called out next to the normal `examples/Showcase.pdf` workflow, and the run command for `python examples/clipping/01_clear_clipping.py` is documented alongside the other examples.
- Updated `requirements.txt` to install `pdfdancer-client-python` from commit `2e92b4e1822e170848f210b3c90d679b59983ebc`, which is the client revision that includes the `clear_clipping()` support used by this repository example.
